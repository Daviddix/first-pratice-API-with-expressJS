<h1>Project Overview</h1>

This project marks my first dive(i would say second tho) into full-stack territory, and I've picked up a bunch of new skills along the way. <br><br>
 It started off as a small vanilla JavaScript project, just to practice the fundamentals But then, I thought, why not spice it up a bit and throw in a backend since I was also learning of Node.js at the time, so I decided to give it a shot.

It started off with the previous anime API i built a while back then, i built the frontend on top of that with some additional features like 
<li>protected routes</li>
<li>Functional UI(an ugly one tho)</li>
<li>Login</li>
<li>Signup</li>
<br>
It was really fun tbh, even though it's not flawless â€“ far from it, actually. The main flaw? Well, I messed up the error handling on the backend. But hey, they say you learn more from your failures, right?

Despite its quirks, tackling this full-stack project has been a journey, and I'm not stopping here. I'm sticking to this full-stack road, fixing up what went wrong, and learning as I go. Excited to see where this journey takes me!
